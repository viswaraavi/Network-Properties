# The function should return a DataFrame with two columns, ​id and ​articulation ​, 
# where articulation is a 1 if the node is an articulation point, otherwise a 0.

A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network – single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more disconnected components. They are useful for designing reliable networks.
For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.
